# SauceDemo Test Automation

This is an automated UI testing project for [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com) using:
- Java

- Cucumber
- Maven
## Features

- Login with invalid credentials

## Other information
The default browser is set to chrome. <br>
After logging in, a "change password" prompt appears on the inventory page, which disrupts the test flow. To prevent this, I configured ChromeOptions to disable Chromeâ€™s password manager during driver setup.
